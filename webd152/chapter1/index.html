    <p>Besides water, I like drinking all sorts of beverages, when I'm getting coffee my favorite is a vanilla latte. 
    If I'm in need of a caffein drink I can get quicker because I'm running late to work 
    or something, I usually go for energy drinks, specifically a reign energy drink or a
    ghost energy drink. As for soda I tend to get diet sodas such as diet coke, diet pepsi or even a diet
    mountain dew but the best soda is a mexican coke.
